## 🔬 Research Experience

### 1. Research on Lane Line Detection Method Based on Deep Learning
**Computer Vision Lab, Anhui University** | *2025.XX - Present* | *First Author*

This work addresses challenges in existing lane line detection methods in complex urban traffic scenarios, including inaccurate geometric fitting, discontinuous detection results due to slender structures, large curvature changes, occlusions, and drastic lighting variations.

**Key Contributions:**
- Proposed a method based on cross-layer refinement network (CLRerNet)
- Introduced dynamic snake convolution (DSConv) to enhance adaptive modeling capability for slender curved structures
- Improved Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with gated attention mechanism for efficient multi-scale feature fusion
- Designed structured loss function to constrain lane line prediction from multiple dimensions (spatial continuity, local smoothness, topological connectivity)

**Results:** Experimental results on CULane and CurveLanes datasets show significant superiority over existing baseline models, especially demonstrating stronger robustness and higher detection accuracy in curved lane and occlusion scenarios.

**Status:** Submitted to *Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI)* as first author, currently under review.

### 2. Modeling and Forecasting of Interval-Valued Seasonal Time Series
**Provincial University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, Anhui University** | *2024.XX - Present* | *Core Contributor*

This project focuses on interval-valued seasonal time series modeling, where existing methods often fail to adequately capture the interplay between interval upper/lower bounds and interval width.

**Key Contributions:**
- Proposed Holt-Winters interval-valued multiplicative decomposition model
- Achieved collaborative prediction of interval centers and widths
- Constructed decomposition and fitting strategies suitable for interval data

**Results:** Experimental results on multiple real-world interval-valued time series datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms Holt-Winters interval-valued additive models and Holt-Winters point-valued decomposition models in terms of IMSE and IMAE evaluation metrics.

**My Role:** Primarily responsible for model implementation, data visualization, and design/implementation of comparative models.

**Status:** Submitted to *Journal of Time Series Analysis*, currently under review.
